# Linux-Server-VM-Sandbox
VirtualBox Ubuntu Server 22.04 home lab/vnet setup with SSH and monitoring tools. Plans include hosting a weight & fitness tracker app, along with anything else interesting I come across to stand up. (I'm already running a Plex media server from another project, protected behind a pfSense firewall.)
