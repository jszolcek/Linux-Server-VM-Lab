# Linux-Server-VM-Sandbox
VirtualBox Ubuntu Server 22.04 home lab setup with SSH and monitoring tools (probably going to host a health + fitness tracker  app on it, and anything else I find interesting to host, (already hosting a Plex media server from another project behind a pfSense firewall))


See the full [sandbox_log.md](sandbox_log.md) for detailed logs of what I've done in this lab lately.
