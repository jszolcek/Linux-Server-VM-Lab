### 🏗️ Home Lab Setup History

1. 💻 Created a new VirtualBox VM  
   Installed the latest Ubuntu Server 22.04 distro.

2. 🛠️ Installed essential programs on the VM  
   - OpenSSH Server (to enable SSH access)  
   - Prometheus (planning to add Grafana later)

3. 🔍 Discovered VM IP address  
   Ran `ip a` on the VM, identified IP on interface `enp0s3`.

4. 🔄 Changed VirtualBox network adapter  
   Switched from Bridged to NAT for isolation.

5. 🔑 Set up SSH key authentication  
   - Generated SSH key on Windows host  
   - Added public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on VM  
   - Disabled password login on SSH server

6. 🚪 Configured VirtualBox port forwarding  
   Forwarded host port 2222 to guest port 22 for SSH access.

7. 📄 Fixed public key format issue  
   - Extracted the public key from Windows private key using `ssh-keygen -y`  
   - Manually added the corrected public key string to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on VM  
   - Set correct permissions on `.ssh` folder and `authorized_keys` file

8. 🔗 Connected from Windows via SSH (passwordless)  
   Using forwarded port and SSH key for passwordless login.
